# BlockRandomizer
A Minecraft spigot plugin compatible with 1.17.0 that swaps all of a block in a world with another block every 5 minutes.

This plugin can cause a lot of server lag and was only tested with a server using 3G of dedicated ram. The randomization ends when someone acquires the achivement "free the end". It can be considered a challenge mode where you attempt to beat the game despite block randomizations.
